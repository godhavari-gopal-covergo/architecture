### Summary
Kate Oconer demonstrated the promo code functionality on the proposal screen, which validates codes against Talon one, allows users to apply up to five codes, and includes a "View Code List" for tracking valid, invalid, and removed codes. Following a discussion, Kate Oconer agreed to limit promo codes to one per quotation, and NATHANAEL G'BAMY committed to checking the rules for combining promo and referral codes, while Kate Oconer clarified that the system does not support automatic code application and that only one valid referral code is allowed per quotation. EMMA NGHIEM inquired about displaying common promotions with future effects, such as free months, and Kate Oconer explained that the quotation's "Total Discount" only reflects immediate impacts, with future effects stored and applied via a job run, which NATHANAEL G'BAMY confirmed are based on statuses received from Talon one. Quentin Pilet and Yashpal Deswal questioned the promo code budget responsibility, which FABIEN DEGRAVEL confirmed is covered by the marketing budget, leading EMMA NGHIEM and NATHANAEL G'BAMY to agree to confirm internally if family discounts are adjusted against the SET marketing budget.
### Details
*Notes Length: Standard*
* **Promo Code Functionality on Proposal Screen** Kate Oconer demonstrated the promo code entry feature on the Cover Health proposal/quotation screen, which allows users to enter a promo code that is validated against talent one and displayed in the premium breakdown ([00:00:00](#00:00:00)). They clarified that some promo codes have a future effect and will be listed as valid in the breakdown even if they don't have an immediate monetary amount ([00:01:13](#00:01:13)). Users can add up to five promo codes per quotation, and the system prevents adding more if five valid codes are already applied ([00:02:27](#00:02:27)).
* **Managing Promo Codes and Code List** Kate Oconer explained the \`View Code List\` feature, which displays all codes, including valid, invalid, and removed ones, to assist customer service in tracking issues raised by customers ([00:03:51](#00:03:51)). They showed that users can remove promo codes and must enter a reason for removal for tracking purposes, with the removal description being visible on the code list ([00:04:59](#00:04:59)). NATHANAEL G'BAMY questioned if the system could be personalized to allow only one promo code per quotation and if automatic code application based on parameters, such as the family VIP code for two animals, was possible ([00:06:17](#00:06:17)).
